Results:
  Native methods called by the container generated by code analysis:
  /result/static/code_analysis

  System calls obtained from different granularity analyses(RQ1):
  /result/static/result_different_granularity/

  Results of static analysis:
  /result/static/result_final/

  Results of dynamic analysis:
  /result/dynamic/result_final/

  Combining and redundantly eliminating the results of static and dynamic analysis:
  /result/combine/
