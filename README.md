system call allowlist for java container

## Code Analysis:
**/src/main/java/com/sspku/jtracer/bytecode_new/NewByteCodeTracer.java**

Code Analysis is currently for tomcat.
If you want to analyse other projects, you need to replace tomcat with the appropriate project in the java code and pom files.


## Cross Language Interface Dependency Analysis & Binary Analysis:
**binary_analyser.py**

Cross Language Interface Dependency Analysis & Binary Analysis is currently for tomcat. 
If you want to analyse other projects, you need to modify "native_methods" and function "build_xxx_map" in binary_analyser.py.

## Results:
  ### Native methods called by the container generated by code analysis:
  /result/static/code_analysis

  ### System calls obtained from different granularity analyses(RQ1):
  /result/static/result_different_granularity/

  ### Results of static analysis:
  /result/static/result_final/

  ### Results of dynamic analysis:
  /result/dynamic/result_final/

  ### Combining and redundantly eliminating the results of static and dynamic analysis:
  /result/combine/
